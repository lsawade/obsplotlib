Obsplotlib
==========

Obsplotlib is a python package for plotting seismic traces, station seismograms,
and seismic sections in a consistent way. It is built on top of matplotlib and
obspy, and is designed to be easy to use and to produce publication quality
figures with minimal effort. Moreover, it is designed to be easily extensible
and customizable, so that users can easily add their own plotting functions,
or modify created plots to their liking.
