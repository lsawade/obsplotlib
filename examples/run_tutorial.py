``obsplotlib`` Tutorial
=======================

The tutorial will go over the plotting functions in ``obsplotlib`` and how to
prepare your data to plot traces, station seismograms and full seismic sections
using ``obsplotlib``. Here and there the tutorial will digress into some
matplotlib details, to show how you could easily customize the plots to your
liking.

# -----

# %%
# In the example above we are providing all possible arguments to the
# ``add_header`` function just for show. Depending on whether they are provided
# they will be added to the header or not. The header is a simple text object
# and all font related arguments are passed through ``plot_label`` and to
# ``plt.text()``. The ``add_newline_station`` and ``add_newline_event`` arguments
# Simply add a newline and a space after the station name and event name.
#
# .. note::
#
#     Digression: At this point you probably already noticed how I'm using
#     a monospace font. You may adjust this to your liking by changing the
#     ``plt.rcParams["font.family"]`` parameter, e.g
#
#     .. code:: python
#
#         plt.rcParams["font.family"] = "Arial"
#
#     Monospace is a personal preference of mine, because it makes it easier to
#     align the header and the labels. But it is not the most beautiful font.
#     Especially, if you are comparing traces and plot labels that contain
#     numbers, it is simpler to compare numbers if they are aligned. Anywho
#     I will enable it for the next section before switching back to monospace.
#
# Station
# -------
#
# The next function is the station function. Instead of plotting a single trace
# it will plot a set of components in a single figure. It's a wrapper around the
# plot trace function, so most arguments are parsed to the trace function. The
# The components are defined by a keyword argument. So you may use ``ZRT``
# ``NEZ`` or ``123`` or just two, ``RT``, for example.

# Switching font to Arial
plt.rcParams["font.family"] = "Arial"

# Get station from observed trace
st = obs.select(network="II", station="BFO")

# Plot the station
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
axes = opl.station(st, components='ZRT', lw=0.5)

# If dissatisfied with legend fontsize and position? Just recreate it using
# the first axes object.
axes[0].legend(frameon=False, loc='lower right', ncol=3, fontsize='small',
               bbox_to_anchor=(1.0, 1.0))

# Add the header with a bit more distance to make room for the legend outside
# the  axes
opl.add_header(axes[0], **header_dict, dist=0.075)

# Slightly adjust the plots to make the fit nicely into the figure
plt.subplots_adjust(left=0.075, right=0.925, top=0.775, bottom=0.15)
plt.show(block=False)

# %%
# Putting the legend outside the axes is nice when we are plotting multiple
# traces to compare them. But if we are only plotting a single stream, it is
# nicer to plot the legend inside the axes. Because it removes some unused
# white space.
#
# Section
# -------
#
# Plotting a section should be simple. And obspy does make it fairly easy, but
# the moment you want to plot a section with multiple components, or align
# traces it becomes fairly complicated. ``obsplotlib`` is trying to streamline
# these processes, by using some function to add properties to the stats object
# of the traces and then using these properties to plot the section. We actually
# already did this earlier in the tutorial when we used
# ``opl.attach_geometry(...)`` to attach the station coordinates to the stats.
# If you don't have a stationxml file, you can use opl.attach_geometry(...)
# after attaching station coordinates to the traces' stats objects, or manually
# add distance, (and optionally, azimuth, and back_azimuth for labels)
# to the stats object. To save space in the section, traces are not plotting by
# their actual distance, but one by one with a label that has the distance.

# Switching back to monospace
plt.rcParams["font.family"] = "monospace"

# Note that we have fewer traces here because some land in the Pwave shadow zone
# and are not recorded but seismographs. Also note, that ax, and ax2 give you
# axes to the left and right yaxes. ax and ax2 ticks actually set the left and
# right y axes labels. So far we have only plotted a single
# component (Z) in the section. ``obsplotlib`` also has a function to plot
# multiple components in a single section. This is done using the
# ``opl.section_multiple_comp`` function. This function takes the same arguments
# But insted of being a single letter string, the components argument is a
# string with all components to be plotted in order.

# One main difference is that the section multiple components will find an
# absmax to normalize across all streams and traces. This can be overwritten by
# absmax parameter which can be manually set.
